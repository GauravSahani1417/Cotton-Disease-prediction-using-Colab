# Cotton-Disease-prediction-using-Colab
### Worked on Cotton disease prediction model using architectures like ResNet50, ResNet152V2, and InceptionV3, from which InceptionV3 gave a better accuracy, and performance compared to other two architectures.
### Not much difference regarding accuracy, was seen between InceptionV3 and ResNet152V2, but since inceptionV3 is based on quiet less parameters, which inturn increase the performance and speed, over ResNet152V2.
